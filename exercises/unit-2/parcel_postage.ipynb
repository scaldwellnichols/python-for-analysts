    "The row for \"Large parcel\" is empty and there are two rows which\n",

    "## A suggested solution using a _declarative_ representation of parcel types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weakness of hard coding the table into complex conditional statements\n",
    "Several years ago, the above problem was used as part of an introductory undergraduate Python course.\n",
    "Most students did write code that gave correct solutions. However, quite a few had code that\n",
    "was correct for some inputs and incorrect for others.\n",
    "When I looked at the submitted code, I saw that nearly all students had tackled\n",
    "the problem in the same way.\n",
    "What they had done is coded the table in terms of a long and complex sequence of\n",
    "`if`, `elif`, `else` statements, with all the numbers embedded directly in the\n",
    "code. Although in most cases the code did work, it was difficult to understand\n",
    "and, in cases where there were errors, they were hard to find. Also, it was\n",
    "apparent that if the information needed to be updated, especially if new categories\n",
    "were added, the required code modification would be somewhat complex and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A _declarative_ approach\n",
    "_Declarative_ programming means that, where possible, a programmer will specify code\n",
    "in terms of static information representing facts, rather than in terms of the\n",
    "dynamic flow of a program. The advantage is that declarative code is easier to\n",
    "understand, alter and modify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course to get the functionality we want, we will usually still need to write some \n",
    "algorithmmic code involving conditionals and loops that will operate on our \n",
    "declaratively stated information. However, because the declarative information\n",
    "is kept separate from this, it often means that the algorithmic code also becomes\n",
    "simpler and easier to understand. And it nearly always means that the code\n",
    "is easier to modify or generalise."
