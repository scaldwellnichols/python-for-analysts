    "As well as showing output when the code explicitly instructs this (for example, the ``print()`` function causes a program to give an output) Jupyter notebook outputs the return value of the final statement in the cell. This is why the very first cell we ran gave an output even though we did not explicitly instruct this using the ``print()`` function. This is a special feature of Jupyter notebooks. If you wrote a Python file contianing the line ``3+5`` using IDLE or a text editor, and then ran the file from the command line, it would not give any output. This can cause some confusion when switching from using notebooks to another context. It's not something to worry about now but it's good to be aware that printing the return value of the final statement in a cell is a feature of the notebook, not of Python. "
