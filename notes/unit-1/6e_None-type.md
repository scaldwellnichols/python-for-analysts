Though often overlooked when considering the basic types of Python, the value `None` (which is the only value of the type `NoneType`) is useful in a variety of circumstances. In particular:

-   `None` is the value that is automatically returned by a function if it reaches the end of the specified codes without reaching a `return` statement. It could also be explicitly returned from a function by the `return` command. The keyword `return` is used by programmers when defining a function to specify what value should be returned by the function. You will explore how to define and use functions in Unit 2.

-   It can be used as an initial value for a variable which later may be given a specific value during execution of the program. Code may check the variable and perform different actions depending on whether it has value `None` or a specific value.

You have seen the basic data types provided by Python and their use with small pieces of code. You have seen that, even at the level of basic data items, there is considerable variety and complexity. You will appreciate more fully, as the course progresses, that this rich framework has been designed primarily to support the programmer in implementation of sophisticated algorithmic processes and data manipulations.

The organisation of information in terms of appropriate types can greatly reduce the complexity of the actual algorithms required and is extremely helpful in enabling programs to be constructed in a systematic and reliable way.
