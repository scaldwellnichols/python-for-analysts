In this activity, you will practise using Jupyter Notebook to edit Python and Markdown.

Learning outcomes

After completing this activity you will be able to:

-   define strings, integers, floats, Booleans
-   assign values to variables
-   make comparisons
-   use numerical operators and several string methods.

This exercise will walk you through some Python code to introduce you to different functions and methods. Make sure you use the notebook interactively to get the most out of it. You should run the code which is already there but also modify it to check your understanding. There are some exercises for you to try. Suggested solutions are included at the end of the notebook but make sure you've made a proper attempt yourself before looking at the answer. There are usually several ways of completing the exercises so don't worry if your solution doesn't look exactly like the one that's provided.

Jupyter exercise

In this exercise you will work with strings and numerical data types.
