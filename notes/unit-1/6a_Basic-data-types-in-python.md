In this lesson, you will see how to write simple pieces of Python code that manipulate data items by applying a variety of computational operators.

Learning outcomes

Successful completion of this lesson will prepare you to:

-   identify and describe data types and their role in programming
-   be able to write code using Python's basic data types and perform operations on these types.

Corresponding to the informal idea that data comes in various different types, nearly all programming languages employ a technical notion of a **data type**. In this technical sense, each data type is associated with specific ways of representing and storing data items of that type, and also with particular operations that can be applied to data of that type.

The most fundamental types of data entity used by Python (sometimes called **primitive** types) are the following:

-   Numbers (of which there are 3 kinds: integers, floats and complex numbers)
-   Booleans (the values `True` and `False`)
-   Strings (sequences of character)
-   `NoneType` (The type of the special value `None` used to indicate the absence of a normal value)

In the next section of this lesson you will be introduced to Number types.
