This lesson explains **conditionals** and **loops**, and how they are used in Python.

### Learning outcomes

Successful completion of this lesson will help you to:

-   understand why conditionals and loop structures are important in programming
-   understand how to write a conditional statement in Python
-   understand how to use `for` and `while` loops in Python.

A computer program is made up of instructions to carry out certain actions. When a program contains more than one instruction a decision has to be made about the order in which instructions are to be carried out. So far we have mainly seen examples of code that is executed **sequentially**. That is, instructions are executed in order reading from top to bottom. This is the default behaviour but having only sequential execution restricts what can be achieved.

Controlling the **flow** of execution allows for more flexibility in a computer program. Instead of performing exactly the same sequence of actions every time the program is executed, the actions performed can depend on some other input data. Some instructions may only be carried out some of the time, other instructions may be carried out multiple times.

In the next section of this lesson you will be introduced to Conditionals.
