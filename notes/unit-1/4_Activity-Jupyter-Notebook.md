Activity: Introduction to Jupyter Notebook[¶](https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/institution/Inter-faculty/ODLC/artificial_intelligence/OCOM5100M_ProgrammingForDataScience/MKDocs_Site/content/unit1/1_04_personal-log-activity/#activity-introduction-to-jupyter-notebook "Permanent link")

In this activity, you will practise using Jupyter Notebook to edit Python and Markdown. You will also create your Personal Log which you will use throughout the module.

Learning outcomes

After completing this activity you will be able to:

-   understand the main features of Jupyter Notebook
-   create Python and Markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook
-   use HTML and LaTeX to format your Jupyter Notebook.

Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks

You will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed to complete these activities. To install Anaconda, follow the guidance on the Anaconda web pages:

-   [Anaconda Home Page](http://www.anaconda.com/)
-   [Anaconda Individual Installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

Once you install Anaconda Python, your system should also be ready to run Jupyter Notebook. The way to start the Jupyter notebook server program will vary depending on the operating system you are using.

On Linux systems, you typically start Jupyter as follows:

-   open a terminal window (for entering system commands)
-   change folder to the folder that will be the start folder for Jupyter
-   start Jupyter with the command:

    ```
    jupyter notebook &
    ```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do the exercises you need to download the .ipynb file and open it with Jupyter notebook. Further instructions are included with the notebook file. A 'View' link (to a HTML page) is also provided, if you just want to have a look at the file without opening it in Jupyter. (But do not try using the HTML file to do the exercise.)

### Jupyter exercise

This exercise will walk you through some very simple Python code so you can get used to using the Jupyter notebook.


-   Download exercise (.ipynb): [Getting Started with Python and Jupyter](../../exercises/unit-1/Ex_1_0_Getting_Started.ipynb)

### Jupyter exercise

This exercise will introduce you to the Markdown language and suggests a variety of tasks which will help you learn about some key features of Markdown. You will make a start on a Personal Log which you are encouraged to re-visit and extend throughout your studies on this module.

You have looked at the main features of Jupyter Notebook, how to create Python and Markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook. You have also used HTML and LaTeX to format your Jupyter Notebook.

In the next lesson you will look at the role of data in computer programming, as well as concepts such as concepts of data and data structure.
