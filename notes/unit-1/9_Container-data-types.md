The aim of this notebook is to help you become familiar with lists and dictionaries. There are no specific exercises in this one but you should use the examples given and modify them to check your understanding. These data structures are core to programming in Python so keep writing your own examples based on those given until you are sure you understand and you are comfortable with the syntax.

You should now be comfortable working with lists and dictionaries. In the next lesson you will look at control structures, which will allow you to write more complex procedures.

In the next lesson you will look at some more complex data types.
