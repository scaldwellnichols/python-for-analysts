Learning outcomes

After completing this activity you will be able to:

-   interpret Python code including function definitions and calls
-   define your own functions.

Jupyter exercise

This notebook contains a worked example of a small system. It demonstrates how functions can be used to split a program into components and so make it more understandable. It will also give you an opportunity to review many of the ideas from Unit 1. Study the situation described and the code provided and make sure that you understand how it works. You could also try modifying the code if you wish, this should aid your understanding.
